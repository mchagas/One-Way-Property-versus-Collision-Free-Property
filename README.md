# One-Way-Property-versus-Collision-Free-Property
This is a Python implementation to break                                                                                                          
1)One-way hash property                                                                                                                    
2)Collision-Free hash property                                                                                                                 
using Brute force method for the first n hex bits. I have taken first n (=5 i.e 20 binary bits) bits of hash.                                          
Then, the program presents a comparitive statistics of the two approaches as two which one is easier to break.
